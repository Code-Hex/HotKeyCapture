This is a sandboxed of custom global hotkeys in Swift using HotKeyCapture
## About
HotKeyCapture is an easy to use Cocoa class for registering an application to respond to system key events, or "hotkeys".  
A global hotkey is a key combination that always executes a specific action, regardless of which app is frontmost. For example, the Mac OS X default hotkey of "command-space" shows the Spotlight search bar, even if Finder is not the frontmost application.
